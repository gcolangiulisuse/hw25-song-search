# Song Search (Hackweek 25)

This repository hosts the code for my **openSUSE Hackweek 25** project.

The goal is testing **CLAP** (Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining) library to test the natural language text search of song. Future step could be song tagging or maybe the integration with an LLM.
