# Song Search (Hackweek 25)

This repository hosts the code for my **openSUSE Hackweek 25** project.

The primary goal is to evaluate the **CLAP (Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining)** library for searching songs using natural language. Future roadmap items include automated song tagging and LLM integration.
